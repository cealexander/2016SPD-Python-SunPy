# SPD 2016 Introduction to Scientific Python and SunPy

This repository contains the material presented at the 
* Introduction to Scientific Python Session (Tuesday, May 31st, 2016)
* SunPy 0.7 (Thursday, June 2nd, 2016)
sessions at the 47th [SPD meeting 2016](http://www.nso.edu/SPD2016-schedule) which took place in Boulder CO.

# Installing Python
The easiest way to get Python up and running on your system is to use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) a python distribution and packacking system. You can find more information [here](http://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/guide/installation/index.html#installing-scientific-python-and-sunpy). We recommend that you install Python 3.

# Background
The scientific Python stack consists of the following 
+ [NumPy](http://numpy.org) - [docs](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/index.html#reference)
+ [SciPy](http://scipy.org) - [docs](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/)
+ [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) - [docs](http://matplotlib.org/contents.html)
+ [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) - [docs](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.18.1/)

as well as

+ [AstroPy](http://astropy.org) - [docs](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/)

# Recommended Python Tools

+ [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) - Python distribution and packaging system (the only way to fly!)
+ [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - Python IDE
+ [atom](https://atom.io) - Text editor for code
+ [jupiter notebook](http://jupyter.org) - Available with anaconda, [docs](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
+ [Spyder](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/) - Python IDE (included with anaconda)
